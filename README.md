# Kickstarting with Excel
The large amount of data in the KickStarter spreadsheet has deep insights into guiding KickStarter activities. The tools in Excel reveal specific relevant data points, which helps us better operate KickStarter.
# Overview of Project
This project will dive into the specifics of running a successful Kickstarter campaign focused on theater, specifically plays. The project will highlight timeframes and ranges of funding that have higher success rates to give your play Kickstarter the optimal odds for success.
# Purpose
The motivation for this analysis to give the Kickstarter campaign the best opportunity for success.
# Analysis and Challenges
The analysis covers many aspects, focusing on the achievements of KickStarter theater. The project takes into account the start date, the amount of funds required and the number of supporters, to name just a few data points. The size of the data set is large, so screening a large amount of data and dialing key data related to the theater is the main challenge. Tools in Excel allow very specific data analysis.
# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis points out that may is the best month to achieve success, but success is also affected by other factors. But then it showed a downward trend.
# Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Financial goals are a major driver of success in forecasting. The higher the goal, the higher the expected failure rate.
# Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge of this analysis is to select the most influential subset of data to illustrate the best guide for successful initiators. The clearer the data, the better it can show the process and reason of the whole data change.
# Results
路 What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
I can draw a conclusion that the end of sring / early summer is the best month for theater audiences. The second conclusion that can be drawn is that the most failed dramatic events occur in October.
路 What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There are no cancelled plays, and there is no exchange between whether there are more successes or failures.
路 What are some limitations of this dataset?
Different regions and cultures will certainly change the possibility of success or failure.
路 What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can create a histogram to compare countries with the amount of financial support,
